# Consider a software utility called ‘bq’ that allows the user to read runtime, persistent data structures

**Commands:**

``` sh
bq                  | Starts utility from linux command prompt
rel <relation name> | Specify which data structure, also known as a relation, to access
di                  | Display data structure of relation identified
key 
key <key values>    | Request system to prompt for key values for the relation identified, or specify the key to read
re k                | Read the record associated with the key value identified
re f                | Read the first record
re l                | Read the last record
re n                | Read the next record
re p                | Read the previous record
x                   | Exit the utility
```

_Upload into your Github / Gitlab or Bitbucket account a solution for the following problems:_

## Problem #1

- I have a relation ABC.
- What are the sequence of commands to determine its structure?

## Problem #2

- I have a relation XYZ.
- Its structure is noted below:

``` sh
XYZ =  { file (B1) of } record
  B1   : integer;     { block number   B1
  Name : Char8;       { B1 name
end;
```

- What are the sequence of commands to read the first and last records of relation XYZ?

## Problem #3

- Continuing with relation XYZ
- What are the sequences of commands to read key value 10 and the next 2 records?
